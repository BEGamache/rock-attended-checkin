## How we work

Our team works 100% off of Github, and it should always remain updated with what is currently in active development.  Bugfixes or feature releases will be tracked in separate branches.

### Pull Requests

We work extensively from pull requests and are constantly monitoring new PR's.

When considering pull requests, we may require more than one person to sign off, so these might take a day or two.

## How can I contribute?

One way you can contribute is by tackling known issues.

### Where to Find Known Issues

We use [GitHub Issues](./issues) for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.

### Reporting New Issues

The best way to get a bug fixed is to provide an example case of where the problem is occurring. Images or videos of the failure occurring is beneficial where applicable. 

If you think you have a solution to a bug and would like to fix it, please let us know. We can hopefully provide recommendations, as well as let you know if the bug is in fact intended behavior.

### How can I recommend new features?

We track feature requests using [GitHub Issues](./issues). If you would like to begin a discussion about a new or improved feature, open a new issue.

### Pull requests

When working to fix bugs or add features, we recommend opening a pull request early so we can comment on it or request any changes early on. 

We also recommend that you work off of open issues, and let us know on them what you will be working on for the same reason.

**Please submit your pull request on the `master` branch**.

## Style Guide

### Git

#### Issues
- Before opening an issue, search existing issues and closed issues for any current or past discussion about your topic.

#### Commits and commit messages
- Try to limit each commit to one bugfix or one logical change.
- Commits messages should be short and clear.
- Feel free to reference issues and pull requests in commit messages.

#### Pull Requests
- Refer to the [above instructions](#pull-requests) on what to do before opening a pull request.

### Code

#### General

* **Most important: Look around.** Match the style you see used in the rest of the project.
* Follow the [Rock coding standards](https://github.com/SparkDevNetwork/Rock/wiki/Coding-standards).
* Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
* Submit "Attractive" code.  This means your variables are human readable, methods are named for what they do, etc.
